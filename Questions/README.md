Mini-Presentation Assignment

Time: 5–10 minutes

Goal: Demonstrate conceptual understanding of the topics to be discussed in class.

Your Task

Prepare a short presentation that addresses the core questions assigned for the session. Your presentation should focus on concepts, reasoning, and interpretation, rather than implementation details or code.

You may use slides, the board, or a brief visual illustration if helpful. Clear explanation and logical structure are more important than formal presentation style.

## Course Overview

Machine Learning II is a PhD-level course that builds on foundational machine learning knowledge and shifts the focus from *how to run models* to *how and why models work—or fail—in real-world settings*. While ML I emphasizes predictive performance, ML II emphasizes **methodological understanding, statistical validity, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability**.

The course situates machine learning methods within a broader statistical and scientific framework, with emphasis on high-dimensional and complex data.

> **Core theme:**  
> *Machine Learning II is not about learning more models—it is about learning when, why, and how machine learning methods can be used responsibly and rigorously.*

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
1. Critically evaluate machine learning methods and their assumptions
2. Distinguish prediction from inference and understanding
3. Assess robustness, uncertainty, and generalizability
4. Apply supervised learning methods responsibly
5. Communicate methodological choices clearly

## What to Expect

- Homework approximately **every two weeks** (theory + coding)
- Short in-class quizzes on fundamentals
- Midterm: project-based assignment
- Final: oral exam focusing on conceptual understanding

## Required Software

This course requires the use of the following statistical and typesetting software:

- R (http://cran.us.r-project.org) is a free programming language for statistical computing, graphics, and machine learning. RStudio is a free IDE for R (https://posit.co/downloads/).
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch or equivalent)
